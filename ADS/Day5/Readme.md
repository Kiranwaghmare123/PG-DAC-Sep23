# Characteristic of Algorithm:

    * Input - 0/more input
    * Output -atleast one output
    * finite
    * unambiguity
    * effective

# AoA : Algorithm complexity
---------------------------
    1. Time factor:
    	-Time is measured by counting the number of key operations such as comparisions in the algorithms (sorting/searching)
    	-Time complexity
    	
    2. Space factor:
    	-Space is measured by counting the maximum memory space required by the algorithms.
    	-Space complaxity
    	
# Asymptotic Notations:

    -Asymptoic notation of an algorithm refers to defining the mathematical boundations of its run-time performance. Using asymptotic analysis, we can conclude, best case, average case and worst case scenario of the algorithm 

    	1. Best case: Minimum time required for program execution.
    	2. Worst case: Maximum time required for program execution
    	3. Average case: Average time required for program execution.


  # Order of Time complexity:

      O(1) < O( log(n) ) < O(n) < O( n log(n) ) < O ( n2 ) < O ( 2n ) < O ( n!)
